A single-compartment, conductance-based (Hodgkin-Huxley style) computational neuron model 
was developed to simulate neuron behaviors under experimental protocols used in this 
study. The model incorporates the fast sodium, persistent (slowly inactivating) sodium,
delayed rectifier potassium, potassium M, high-voltage activated calcium-L, 
calcium-dependent potassium, and leakage currents

The script run_clampV_groups.m reproduces the experimental results on voltage ramp 
for 5 groups of neurons and decomposes acsending an descending PICs in control conditions and
after blockade of the specific currents. 

The script run_gNaP_increase.m shows a potential effect of increasing conductance of the persistent 
sodium current resulting in transition of tonic neuron activity to bursting.
